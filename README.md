# ðŸ“˜ C Programming Assignments :-

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level C programs developed as part of my college coursework. Each file demonstrates a core programming concept in C. The repository includes both source files (`.c`) and compiled executables for ease of testing.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Make sure you have GCC installed on your system.

To compile and run any file:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
```
---
For programs using math functions like `sqrt()`, link the math library using `-lm`:

```bash
gcc quadratic-solver.c -o quadratic-solver -lm
./quadratic-solver
```

## âœ… Compilation Example

```bash
gcc vote.c -o vote
./vote
```

For math functions:

```bash
gcc quadratic-solver.c -o quadratic-solver -lm
./quadratic-solver
```

## ðŸ“š Educational Purpose

These programs demonstrate key C programming concepts:

* Input/output operations
* Control structures (if-else, loops)
* Mathematical operations
* Operator usage (++, precedence)
* Data types and conversion
